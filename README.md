# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Flight Data

## Project Description
This project focuses on conducting a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of flight routes. The objective is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and gain insights into the data's structure. The analysis includes visualizations, summary statistics, and correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

## Installation Instructions
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

# Key Components of the EDA
* Data Importation and Initialization: The analysis begins by importing the necessary Python libraries and loading the flight data into a pandas DataFrame.
* Summary Statistics: Generating descriptive statistics to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
* Data Visualization: Utilizing matplotlib and seaborn to create various plots, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to visualize the distribution and relationships of key features.
* Correlation Analysis: Evaluating the relationships between variables to identify potential multicollinearity or dependencies.
* Anomaly Detection: Identifying any outliers or unusual patterns in the data that may warrant further investigation.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes flight routes with several variables, such as departure and arrival locations, flight times, and other relevant characteristics. The EDA focuses on analyzing these variables to understand the dataset's overall structure and uncover insights that may inform further feature engineering or model development.

# Results & Visualizations
The notebook provides a variety of visualizations that help to elucidate the data's underlying patterns and relationships. These visualizations are crucial for understanding the data before applying any machine learning models.
